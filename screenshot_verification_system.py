SCREENSHOT VERIFICATION & ANTI-CHEAT SYSTEM

CURRENT SYSTEM (Manual):
- Admin manually reviews all screenshots
- Checks for game mode, scores, authenticity
- Resolves disputes manually
- Time-consuming but accurate

FUTURE OCR SYSTEM (Automated):
- OCR reads text from screenshots
- Extracts scores, placements, game modes
- Cross-references with game APIs
- Flags suspicious submissions

ANTI-CHEAT MEASURES:

1. SCREENSHOT VALIDATION:
   - Check image metadata for editing
   - Verify screenshot dimensions match game
   - Detect photoshopped elements
   - Compare with known game UI elements

2. CROSS-VERIFICATION:
   - Multiple players submit same match
   - Results must match between opponents
   - Timestamp verification
   - Game session validation

3. BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS:
   - Track player win rates
   - Flag impossible scores
   - Monitor submission patterns
   - Detect fake accounts

4. REAL-TIME VERIFICATION:
   - Live streaming during matches
   - Screen recording requirements
   - Video proof for high-stakes tournaments
   - Admin spectator mode

IMPLEMENTATION PHASES:

Phase 1 (Current): Manual Admin Review
- Admin checks all screenshots
- Manual dispute resolution
- 100% human verification

Phase 2 (OCR): Semi-Automated
- OCR extracts basic data
- Admin reviews flagged submissions
- Faster processing

Phase 3 (AI): Fully Automated
- AI detects fake screenshots
- Automatic winner determination
- Human review only for disputes

Phase 4 (API Integration): Real-Time
- Direct game API integration
- Live match verification
- Impossible to fake results
